# Pavia

This is the unoffical repository for everything map related in Pavia. 



## QGIS

[QGIS](qgis.org) is the main GIS tool for interacting with the map. This is open soure and free to use. 


## Data

The main data comes from the [Pavia](pavia.io) website. The full link for the coordinates is: 

https://map.pavia.io/#/app.d5f05d85.js/src/utils/coordinates.js

This cannot be used directly, maybe someone knows how. You have to get the coordinate.js file by using a source inspector. 



## Technical Details

### Projection
The projection used is false and gives just 1m between the centre point of the plots. This will be updated as more information becomes available.


## Naming

The names on the map have been sourced from different people in Discord. 

Whale Bay was named by @savitar. 
Bison Beach and The Ranch Lands we more suggestions. 
Yo Bro Slums is from an early discussion regarding the price. 

## Plot 51, -11
